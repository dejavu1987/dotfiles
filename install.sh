# Assume that we have installed the dotfiles to /home/rando/.dotfiles.
# We cannot rely only on pwd as we could invoke our script using an absolute
# path from anywhere on our system. We want the full path to the script's location.
#
# $0 is the command exactly as it was called from the command line.
# For example if we ran install.sh from the directory within which it is contained,
# then $0 would be ./install.sh (a single dot signifies the current location in the file system).
# But if we ran install.sh from somewhere else on our system and used a full path
# to the script, then $0 might be something like /home/rando/.dotfiles/install.sh
#
# Next up, dirname returns the directory portion of the value contained in $0.
#
# We therefore use cd to first change into the script's location and only then run a pwd.
# We can now be confident we have the full absolute path to where our install script can be found.

# ZSH
###############################################################################
section "ZSH"

# There are different types of shell sessions and these determine the files
# that are loaded upon the start of that shell session.
#
# The types include:
# - login
# - interactive
# - non-login
# - non-interactive
#
# To keep this simple, interactive is a shell session where you, the user, can
# interact with the shell via commands you type in at the prompt. Login refers
# to the system identifying you by your login (if you SSH into a system you have
# to log into it first; on MacOS or Windows 10 you are already logged into your
# user account).
#
# Most of your usage will likely be in an interactive login shell. For example,
# if you open the terminal program in either MacOS or Windows 10 WSL2 you enter
# into an interactive login session.
#
# If you load another shell (e.g. /bin/bash) after your login shell session has started
# you may be in an interactive, non-login state. But we're talking about configuring
# zsh and making it the default so switching to another shell altogether is beside the point.
#
# ZSH will load files in a specific order based on the type of shell session.
# ZSH will also only load certain files based on the type so not all are loaded up.
#
# The order within which files are sourced/read are as follows:
# -------
# .zshenv
# [Sourced: Always]
# This file is always sourced regardless of the type of session. As the name implies
# it is most commonly used to set any environment variables that may be required.
# Be warned though that this file is sourced even if zsh is used to run just a quick,
# single command using the -c option as is done by other tools (e.g. make). As such any
# changes you make to this file may have a further reaching impact so be cautious.
# -------
# .zprofile
# [Sourced: Login]
# There might be a tendency to want to put everything inside of your .zshrc file
# by default and that is often the advice given. It has merit in that it keeps things
# simple and you'll always know where to look.
#
# Personally, I put most things inside of .zshrc but use .zprofile for two main categories:
#   - Paths
#   - User Commands
#
# An example of a user command is to run the `rbenv init` command if it is installed.
# -------
# .zshrc
# [Sourced: Interactive]
# You will make most of your changes and customisations within your ~/.zshrc file.
# These would include:
# * Prompt
# * Command completions
# *
# I use oh-my-zsh which is a helpful framework for managing ZSH configurations. It also
# includes many helpful plugins that you can easily activate. It is within .zshrc that
# you source oh-my-zsh and set any plugins you wish to use.
#
# Normally you would put Aliases inside your .zshrc file but oh-my-zsh allows us
# to create aliases and keep our .zshrc file clean. When using Oh My ZSH, aliases are loaded
# from ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/aliases.zsh.
# For a full list of active aliases (be those set by yourself or any plugins),
# simply run `alias` from your terminal.
# -------
# .zlogin
# [Sourced: Login]
# The official zsh documentation states that `.zlogin' is not the place for alias definitions,
# options, environment variable settings, etc. As a general rule, it should not change the
# shell environment at all.  Rather, it should be used to set the terminal type and run
# a series of external commands (fortune, msgs, etc).
#
# So its a good place to show a message to the user upon login or output a fortune piped through cowsays.
# -------
# .zlogout
# [Sourced: Logging out of a Login shell session]
# Any kind of clean-up you may want to run upon logging out. I don't use this file locally.

# Start by installing the latest version of ZSH on our system
step "Installing ZSH"
if is_macos; then
# It seems that using brew install of zsh on MacOS Catalina throws an error
# about insecure directories and files when running compinit required by the
# zsh-completions plugin for oh-my-zsh.
# It won't show an error until you open a fresh instance of zsh but there
# is an easy solution to fix things.
# Simply run:  compaudit | xargs chmod g-w

# Install oh-my-zsh which is a handy framework for enhancing zsh
step "Installing oh-my-zsh"
# You could run the official install script to get Oh-My-ZSH on your machine.
# But I find it requires a few too many extra steps to get right in the context
# of continuing to run through our entire script.
#
# One of the issues with using the official ohmyzsh install script is that,
# by default, the script will run `zsh -l` after all steps are complete.
# This will start a fresh instance of the zsh shell after it installs everything.
# We definitely do not want this as it will terminate our dotfiles script and
# nothing else beyond that point will get installed.
# Thankfully, there is a toggle for that behaviour by setting RUNZSH=no (the default is yes).
#
# That solves one problem, but the install script will want a .zshrc file to exist
# in our user's home directory. We have our own .zshrc file that we symlink into place
# after intalling ohmyzsh.
#
# We could set KEEP_ZSHRC=yes (default no) but this only keeps an existing .zshrc file.
# If one doesn't exist at all at this stage the automated ohmyzsh install script
# will use a default template and create a ~/.zshrc for us.
# This would cause our step to symlink our own .zshrc to fail as the destination
# for the link already exists thanks to the ohmyzsh install script.
#
# You might wonder why we don't symlink our own zshrc file into place before running
# the ohmyzsh install script. And that's a good question.
# That will solve the issue of using its zshrc template instead of our settings.
# But we reference some plugins that aren't yet installed in our zshrc file.
# If we try to install those custom plugins ahead of running the script then installation
# will stop since the ~/.oh-my-zsh folder now exists (custom plugins go into ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/).
# We could solve this by letting the install script run and create its own zshrc
# file from the template and then just `rm ~/.zshrc` before we symlink our own into place.
# But that just seems a bit pointless when we can just do a manual install using git clone.
